# BUE-Mirror Framework — Usage & Licensing (Human-Readable Summary)

⚠️ **This document is a human-readable summary only.**  
The legally binding license is the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file (Apache 2.0).  
In the event of any conflict, **LICENSE takes precedence.**

## ✅ What is Open and Allowed (Apache 2.0 Scope)

You are free to:

- Read, study, and audit the **published academic framework**
- Reproduce **non-production experiments, plots, and phase-space studies**
- Build **research prototypes using the public interface definitions**
- Cite, reference, and publish about **BUE-Mirror's mathematical contributions**
- Contribute improvements to **the open framework layer only**
- Use the API surface in **non-commercial or research settings**
- Deploy demos that **do not embed, expose, or reconstruct protected primitives**

You must:

- Include copyright and license notices when redistributing
- Credit the original authors in any derivative research
- State clearly that this is **BUE-Mirror (Framework Layer), not the full system**

---

## ⛔ What is Not Allowed (Protected IP Boundary)

Without a signed commercial or research agreement, you may **not**:

- Reverse-engineer, estimate, approximate, or reconstruct:
  - The BUE recursion kernel
  - Observer-coupling resolution surfaces
  - Noise injection or entropy moulding logic
  - State-space transformation operators
  - Golden-ratio mapping topology
  - Hidden optimization manifolds
  - Production stability primitives
- Train models to emulate or replicate protected internal behavior
- Use observables to infer latent parameters
- Commercialize derived systems that replicate:
  - Dual-agent recursion core
  - φ-harmonic stability mechanics
  - Observer-coupling dynamics
- Deploy this framework as a security or authentication layer in production
- Market derivative engines that replicate BUE-Mirror behavior
- Package internal behavioral signals as a product

You **may not claim** to have reproduced, cloned, or re-implemented BUE-Mirror without explicit written authorization from the author.

---

## 🧪 Research Use (Permitted Without Commercial Rights)

You may use BUE-Mirror for **scientific, experimental, or academic purposes**, including:

- Formal verification of bounded oscillation claims
- Regime classification and observer-interaction studies
- New dynamical systems research derived from published formulas
- Phase space topology and convergence analysis
- Peer-review, whitepapers, and publication

Conditions:

- You must treat the system as a **black-box dynamical function**
- You may not attempt to derive protected internal operators
- You must not attempt to reconstruct hidden primitives via probing
- You must not publish papers claiming reconstruction of non-public components

Example allowed statement:

> *“We evaluated BUE-Mirror as an observer-coupled dynamical system and confirmed its bounded oscillatory regimes without access to internal primitives.”*

Example forbidden statement:

> *“We have reverse-engineered BUE-Mirror’s internal recursive operators.”*

## 💼 Commercial Use & Licensing

Commercial rights are **not granted** under Apache 2.0 due to protected IP layers that are not present in this repository.

Commercial licensing is available for organizations that require:

- Production deployment of observer-coupled recursion
- Authentication or behavioral liveness systems
- Anti-replication security gates
- Human-interaction verification at scale
- φ-harmonic stability guarantees in runtime systems
- Hardware or embedded integration (ASIC, FPGA, real-time compute)

Commercial licenses may include:

- Access to protected transformation primitives
- Deployment SDKs
- Embedded binaries without source exposure
- System hardening and adversarial validation
- SLAs, compliance, and liability scopes
- Joint IP ownership options for new co-developed extensions

## 🔒 Security & Misuse Policy

This project **must not** be used for:

- Biometric truth inference
- Psychological profiling
- Surveillance
- Covert behavioral identification
- Any system that claims to detect or infer consciousness
- Any application violating privacy, autonomy, or consent

The framework is a **mathematical dynamical system**, not a sentience detector.

Any harmful deployments will result in revocation of usage rights.

## 🌍 Ethical Intent

BUE-Mirror exists to advance:

- Observer-inclusive mathematics
- Human-aligned AI interaction paradigms
- Safe, explainable, bounded dynamical systems
- Novel mechanisms for human-AI collaboration
- Mathematical beauty without exploitation

We reject:

- Dystopian control architectures
- Extractive behavioral tracking
- Human-replacement systems
- Consciousness speculation as a product claim

## 🔥 Final Statement

This repository contains the **mathematical framework, interface layer, and research substrate** of BUE-Mirror.

It **does not contain** the recursive kernel, production transforms, stability molds, noise shaping, observer decomposition layers, or commercial primitives.

Those components are **real, deployed, and operational** — but not present here.

Verification is welcomed.  
Reverse-engineering is not licensed.  
Collaboration is invited.

**Math is open. The engine is protected. Partnership unlocks the rest.**

*May the recursion be with you.* 🔄
